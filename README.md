# Bevy RFCs

Thank you for contributing to Bevy! If you've been asked to make an RFC, it's because your contribution is significant enough that it warrants careful thought from the Bevy community.

## Objective
**RFCs are intended as a tool for collaboration, not a burden for you, the contributor.** 

They don't need to be perfect, complete or even very good when you submit them: the goal is to move the discussion into a format where we can give each part of the design the focus it deserves in a collaborative fashion.

## Process
The process is pretty simple:

1. Fork this repository, and create a new branch with your discussion.
2. Create a new folder within the "rfc" folder of this repo, copying the "template" folder. Rename that folder to the feature_name of your feature, and record your thoughts in the "rfc.md" file in there.
3. Open a pull request on this repo, with a one-sentence description of what the RFC is about.
4. Help us discuss and refine the RFC. Take a look at the "Files Changed" and "Conversation" tabs of the pull request to follow along. The insert a suggestion feature of GitHub is extremely convenient for making and accepting quick changes.
5. Present the refined RFC to @cart, Bevy's project lead for approval.
6. Implement (or resume implementing) the RFC in a PR in the main bevyengine/bevy repo.

## Ownership
Having an idea (and opening an RFC) doesn't force you to "own" the feature: feel free to have as much or little engagement with the process as you want. Bevy org members* will have the ability to push and modify your RFC branch freely (just click the allow edits from maintainers button), so there's no need to babysit the process.

*this is a low bar: if you're interested in this role, you only need to show good faith and a short track record in contributing to Bevy (either through discussions or code) and then message @cart on Github or Discord. Bevy org members are not official representatives of the project, have no final decision making power and are not your lawyer.
