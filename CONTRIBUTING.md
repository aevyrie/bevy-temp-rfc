# Bevy's RFC Process

This is a prototype for [Bevy's](https://bevyengine.org) RFC repo.

Discussed at [#1662](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1662).

## Making an RFC

Each PR should add one .md file to the /rfc folder, following rfc-template.md.

When RFCS are accepted, the PR is merged in, creating a file that lives in this folder.
